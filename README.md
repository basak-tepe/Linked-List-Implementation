# Linked-List-Implementation
A linked list implementation I made for my Data Structures and Algorithms course.
The linked list data structure is implemented to represent the product line of a factory. Nodes are represented as holders/boxes connected to each other in this factory line.
Implemented methods are multiple different versions of add,delete,find and set methods.
